# Introduction

Vuescroll is a virtual scrollbar based on [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) 2.X. In addition to the features of native scrollbar, vuescroll has many more fueatures than native, such as toggle among multi modes, smooth-scroll, auto-detect size changes, paging, snapping etc.

## Why Vuescroll
Many people have asked me  **Why not use native?** ， here I list some comparisons between vuescroll and other scrollbar libraries.
### native scrollbar
I think native is too ugly，and its scrollbar is too width， it has a ugliy UX.But vuescroll, besides basic scroll behavior of native，has more features like: be able to detect size change of content， supports pull-refresh and push-load, paging, snapping. 
### iscroll, better-scroll, scroller
iscroll , scroller and better-scroll all do well,  they all have a good UX，but vuescroll has some diffrerence bellow：
* Focus on Vue，pecially design for Vue, 
* Many modes coexist，that is, has native mode and slide mode, toggle flexiable.
